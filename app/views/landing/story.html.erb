            We are a premium eyewear brand that wants to do it right. Too many companies out there cost you an arm and a leg for a decent pair of sunglasses. There must be a better way!
            We started our mission to locate the highest quality materials and a reliable manufacturer.
            To support our fello Americans we narrowed our search to local manufacturers and after a few grueling, yet exhilarating months, we did it!
            Finally sunglasses that have the look and feel of a designer brand for a price that everyone can afford.

            Quality is guaranteed here at Fello Eyewear.
            By sharing us on Facebook when making a purchase we’ll send you a new pair of sunglasses free of charge if you ever lose or break them.
            We call it ‘helping our fellos out’.

            We also believe it is important to help our our fello man. Not just our customers, but those less fortunate.
            Today, there are 530 million people worldwide without access to eye care. We aren’t okay with these numbers, and we know that you aren’t either.
            This is why for every pair of sunglasses you buy, we donate $5 towards providing eye care to the people who need it most.
            Part of our vision is to help those without one.
