    "Fello Eyewear is here to change the game. We are driven by customer satisfaction rather than profit margins.
    The quality of our sunglasses rivals designer brands, but at an affordable price.
    Our sunglasses come with a Promise that can’t be matched, and we are acting on our Vision to help the world."

    "When we say we have your back, we mean it. It sucks spending money on an expensive pair of sunglasses
    that will inevitably break or disappear in a few months. If you back us on Kickstarter you will never have to worry again.
    If your sunglasses are lost, broken, or stolen we'll replace them absolutely free."

    "Today there are nearly 1 Billion people worldwide without access to basic eye care
    (eye exams, prescription lenses, eye drops, etc.). We aren’t okay with these numbers,
    and we know that you aren’t either. This is why for every pair sold we donate $5
    that directly helps a child get the eye treatment they deserve."
